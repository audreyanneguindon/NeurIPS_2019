Lourdes Crivelli and Audrey-Anne Guindon

[Reproduction Paper](reproduction_paper.pdf).

This is a reproduction of Maxime Gasse, Didier Chételat, Nicola Ferroni, Laurent Charlin, and Andrea Lodi's NeurIPS 2019  [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01629).
A copy of our reproduction paper can be found on [Open Review](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1x-_acfaH). This paper was written as part of the [NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility Challenge](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/).
Our reproduction reuses the authors' code, which can be found in the [learn2branch](https://github.com/ds4dm/learn2branch) repository.

## Installation
